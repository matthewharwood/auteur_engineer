# Laws of UX: Practical Design Guidelines

This tutorial distills each law on Laws of UX into actionable advice. For each law you'll find concise "do this" and "don't do this" guidelines that focus on designing better experiences. Historical context has been removed so you can concentrate on what matters: applying the principles in your work.

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

### Do this
- Design interfaces that look appealing and polished – users often perceive beautiful design as more usable
- Use aesthetics to create a positive first impression; people will tolerate minor usability issues when a product looks good

### Don't do this
- Don't rely on visual polish to hide fundamental usability problems – attractive interfaces can mask issues and prevent them being discovered

## Choice Overload

### Do this
- Limit the number of options when a quick decision is important; too many choices overwhelm people
- Provide side-by-side comparison tools (e.g., for pricing tiers) to help users evaluate options
- Prioritize content and offer filters or search to narrow choices

### Don't do this
- Avoid presenting all possible options at once – large menus and complex selection lists impede decision making

## Chunking

### Do this
- Break information into meaningful clusters so users can scan and find what they need quickly
- Use clear hierarchy and visual grouping to align content with how people process information

### Don't do this
- Don't present long, unstructured blocks of information; mixing unrelated items without grouping makes comprehension harder

## Cognitive Bias

### Do this
- Recognize that mental shortcuts (heuristics) influence decision making – they save mental effort but can skew judgement
- Raise awareness of your own biases and encourage your team to challenge assumptions; this reduces the risk of faulty reasoning or discrimination

### Don't do this
- Don't ignore the impact of biases such as confirmation bias – seeking only information that supports preconceived beliefs leads to flawed decisions

## Cognitive Load

### Do this
- Reduce the amount of information users must hold in mind; overload causes mistakes and frustration
- Distinguish between intrinsic load (effort needed to process relevant information) and extraneous load; remove distracting elements that don't help understanding

### Don't do this
- Don't present excessive details or decorative clutter – unnecessary elements increase cognitive load and hinder task completion

## Doherty Threshold

### Do this
- Ensure your interface responds to user actions within roughly 400 ms to maintain engagement
- Use perceived performance techniques – animations or loading indicators – to make wait times feel shorter
- Provide progress bars or other feedback to make waiting tolerable
- Introduce short deliberate delays when appropriate; brief pauses can communicate processing and build trust

### Don't do this
- Don't leave users waiting with no indication of progress; unresponsive interfaces erode trust and productivity

## Fitts's Law

### Do this
- Make interactive targets large enough to be easily selected
- Provide ample spacing between touch targets to prevent accidental taps
- Position important controls where they are easy to reach, reducing the distance users must move

### Don't do this
- Don't crowd small buttons together or place vital actions in hard-to-reach areas – small targets and long distances slow users down and increase error rates

## Flow

### Do this
- Balance the challenge of a task with the user's skill level to induce deep focus
- Provide clear feedback so users know what action was taken and what result was achieved
- Remove unnecessary friction; make features discoverable to keep users engaged

### Don't do this
- Don't make tasks too easy (leading to boredom) or too difficult (causing frustration)
- Avoid hiding features or omitting feedback – both disrupt the flow state

## Goal-Gradient Effect

### Do this
- Display progress toward a goal; people work faster as they sense completion is near
- Provide "artificial progress" (e.g., starting users at 10% complete) to motivate them to continue

### Don't do this
- Don't leave users unsure how far they've progressed – hidden progress demotivates and may lead to abandonment

## Hick's Law

### Do this
- Reduce the number of choices when quick decisions are required
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps to lower cognitive load
- Highlight recommended or default options to guide users
- Use progressive onboarding so new users aren't overwhelmed

### Don't do this
- Don't oversimplify to the point where the purpose becomes unclear – avoid abstraction that confuses users
- Don't present all options at once without guidance; too many choices increase decision time

## Jakob's Law

### Do this
- Design interfaces consistent with patterns users already know; people transfer expectations from familiar products
- Leverage existing mental models so users can focus on their tasks rather than learning new interaction patterns
- When making major changes, offer the option to use the familiar version temporarily

### Don't do this
- Don't radically alter established interactions without support or guidance; forcing users to relearn can lead to confusion and frustration

## Law of Common Region

### Do this
- Group related elements within a clearly defined boundary such as a container or background
- Use borders or shading to create visual regions that help users understand relationships

### Don't do this
- Don't scatter related items without grouping; ambiguous grouping makes relationships hard to understand

## Law of Proximity

### Do this
- Place related items close together to communicate their relationship
- Use spacing to help users organize and scan information efficiently

### Don't do this
- Don't place unrelated items near each other; proximity implies similarity
- Avoid spreading related items across wide spaces that imply they're unrelated

## Law of Prägnanz

### Do this
- Simplify visuals – people prefer the simplest possible interpretation of a complex image
- Present information in simple, ordered forms so it's easier to process and remember

### Don't do this
- Don't overwhelm users with ambiguous or overly complex graphics; complex forms hinder comprehension

## Law of Similarity

### Do this
- Use similar colors, shapes, sizes or movements to indicate that elements belong together
- Ensure links, buttons and navigation differ visually from regular text

### Don't do this
- Don't style unrelated elements similarly; it confuses users
- Avoid making interactive elements look like plain text or vice versa

## Law of Uniform Connectedness

### Do this
- Visually connect related items using lines, colors, borders or shapes so people perceive them as linked
- Use connecting elements (e.g., arrows or lines) to show relationships

### Don't do this
- Don't leave related elements unconnected or separated by unrelated visual cues; users may miss their relationship

## Mental Model

### Do this
- Recognize that users form internal models of how a system works and apply those models to new situations
- Align your design with users' mental models, using familiar patterns like product cards and shopping carts
- Conduct research (interviews, personas, journey maps) to understand and bridge the gap between your mental model and your users'

### Don't do this
- Don't impose your own mental model on users; forcing them to adapt to unfamiliar patterns leads to frustration
- Avoid inconsistent interfaces that contradict users' expectations

## Miller's Law

### Do this
- Organize content into small chunks to help people process and remember information
- Recognize that working-memory capacity varies with the individual and context

### Don't do this
- Don't cite the "magical number seven" to justify arbitrary design limits – it should not be used as a strict rule

## Occam's Razor

### Do this
- Reduce complexity by eliminating unnecessary elements while maintaining essential function
- Continually refine designs until no more elements can be removed without harming the overall experience

### Don't do this
- Don't add features or content that complicate the design without clear user benefit
- Avoid solving simple problems with elaborate solutions

## Paradox of the Active User

### Do this
- Expect users to jump straight into using your product without reading documentation
- Provide contextual help, tooltips and guidance accessible wherever the user happens to be

### Don't do this
- Don't force users to read manuals or lengthy onboarding before they can use your product
- Avoid hiding help or making it difficult to find

## Pareto Principle

### Do this
- Recognize that a small number of causes often produce the majority of outcomes – identify and focus on high-impact areas
- Allocate resources where they will benefit most users

### Don't do this
- Don't distribute efforts evenly across all tasks; over-investing in low-impact areas yields little benefit
- Avoid ignoring the small portion of causes that drive most results

## Parkinson's Law

### Do this
- Set clear, reasonable time expectations for tasks to prevent them expanding unnecessarily
- Reduce task duration below what users expect to improve satisfaction
- Use time-saving features like autofill to speed up forms and checkout

### Don't do this
- Don't allow simple processes to take longer than they should – tasks will fill whatever time is available
- Avoid long forms without shortcuts or automation

## Peak-End Rule

### Do this
- Design experiences to have memorable peaks and strong endings; users judge an experience mostly by its high point and final moments
- Identify when your product is most helpful or entertaining and add delightful details
- Minimize negative peaks because people remember bad moments vividly

### Don't do this
- Don't neglect the conclusion of a user journey; poor endings undermine an otherwise positive experience
- Avoid leaving negative events unaddressed; they will dominate users' memories

## Postel's Law

### Do this
- Be tolerant of various user inputs and behaviors; anticipate different formats and capabilities
- Translate diverse input to meet your system's requirements and provide clear feedback
- Design robust interfaces that can handle unexpected user behavior

### Don't do this
- Don't rigidly enforce narrow input formats; strict validation frustrates users
- Don't send malformed or ambiguous output – be conservative in what your system emits

## Selective Attention

### Do this
- Guide attention to relevant information and minimize distractions; users naturally filter out irrelevant content
- Avoid "banner blindness" by not styling important content like advertisements
- Prevent "change blindness" by ensuring only one significant change occurs at a time and by providing strong cues

### Don't do this
- Don't place essential information in areas typically reserved for ads – people will ignore it
- Don't introduce multiple simultaneous changes without clear cues; users may miss them

## Serial Position Effect

### Do this
- Put critical actions or information at the beginning or end of a list where they're more likely to be remembered
- Place less important items in the middle since they're recalled less often

### Don't do this
- Don't bury key actions in the middle of navigation menus or lists
- Avoid giving equal prominence to all items when some deserve priority

## Tesler's Law

### Do this
- Accept that every process has an irreducible amount of complexity that must be shouldered by either the system or the user
- Handle inherent complexity in the design and development phase to reduce the burden on users
- Provide context-aware guidance and support within the interface
- Consider that users are not always rational; design for real, imperfect behavior

### Don't do this
- Don't build products only for an idealized, rational user; unrealistic expectations lead to frustration
- Don't push complexity onto users when it can be handled by the system

## Von Restorff Effect

### Do this
- Make important actions or information stand out visually to ensure they're remembered
- Use emphasis sparingly so salient items don't compete with each other or appear as advertisements
- Provide multiple contrast cues (e.g., shape, pattern) rather than relying solely on color to accommodate users with visual impairments
- Consider users with motion sensitivity when using motion for emphasis

### Don't do this
- Don't rely exclusively on color to convey importance – some users may not perceive it
- Don't overuse emphasis; too many standout items dilute their impact
- Avoid motion effects that could trigger discomfort or motion sensitivity

## Working Memory

### Do this
- Keep the number of items displayed to 4–7 chunks at any given time and ensure each item is necessary and relevant
- Support recognition over recall by showing which items users have already viewed and providing breadcrumb navigation
- Carry over important information across steps or pages (e.g., comparison tables) so users don't need to remember it

### Don't do this
- Don't overload users' working memory by presenting too much information at once
- Don't force users to memorize information they'll need later; let the system remember for them

## Zeigarnik Effect

### Do this
- Encourage users to continue tasks by clearly signifying that more content or steps are available
- Provide artificial progress toward a goal (e.g., partially completed progress bars) to increase motivation
- Show progress indicators so users understand where they are and what remains

### Don't do this
- Don't leave tasks without visible progress indicators – users may abandon them
- Don't hide future steps or content; lack of signposting reduces motivation to continue
